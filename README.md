# Compressor Design & Optimization ‚Äì Turbomachinery Course Project  

This repository contains the MATLAB Live Script **`CompressorOptimization.mlx`**, developed as part of the **Turbomachinery course** in the 3rd year of Aerospace Engineering.  

The work focuses on the **preliminary design and optimization of an axial compressor stage**, using fundamental relations from thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and turbomachinery design.

## üéØ Objectives  

- Evaluate compressor performance based on design inputs such as **mass flow rate, pressure ratio, and rotational speed**.  
- Apply **aerodynamic and thermodynamic constraints** (e.g., maximum relative Mach number, diffusion factor limits) to ensure feasible design.  
- Optimize compressor stage parameters to balance efficiency, stability, and performance.

## üß© Methodology  

The MATLAB Live Script implements:  

1. **Thermodynamic State Calculations**  
   - Inlet conditions: stagnation temperature T‚ÇÅ, stagnation pressure P‚ÇÅ, and specific gas properties (R, Œ≥, Cp).  
   - Outlet conditions computed using the **isentropic relation** for total temperature rise:  
     ```
     T‚ÇÇ / T‚ÇÅ = (P‚ÇÇ / P‚ÇÅ)^((Œ≥-1)/Œ≥)
     ```  

2. **Velocity Triangle Relations**  
   - Blade speed U estimated from shaft speed and radius.  
   - Flow and relative Mach numbers checked against design constraints.  

3. **Compressor Constraints**  
   - **Relative Mach number constraint**:  
     ```
     M_rel,1 ‚â§ M_rel,max
     ```  
   - **Diffusion factor (DF) constraint**:  
     ```
     DF ‚â§ DF_max
     ```  

4. **Design Parameter Checks**  
   - Hub-to-tip ratio, solidity, and blade geometry feasibility.  
   - Aerodynamic stability margins considered.
